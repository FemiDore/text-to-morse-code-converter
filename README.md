## How It Works
1. The program defines a **dictionary** mapping letters and numbers to Morse code  
2. User input is collected and converted to **uppercase**  
3. Each character in the input is checked against the dictionary:  
   - If the character exists, it’s replaced with its Morse code  
   - If not (punctuation, space, etc.), it’s left unchanged  
4. The resulting Morse code symbols are **joined with spaces** and printed
